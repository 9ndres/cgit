Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

This is a compilation of frequently asked questions on the cgit mailing
list. If you've got a cgit problem and cannot find an answer here, please
send a request to cgit@lists.zx2c4.com (and consider sending a patch to the
cgit wiki branch to update this faq if you get a nice answer to your
question).

### Why doesn't cgit find/show my repo?

This is most likely due to permission problems: cgit runs under your
webserver user account and will need read access to your repo (and all
of the parent directories)


### Why does cgit complain that my repo is "Not a git repository"?

The most common cause of this is permission problems - see the previous
faq entry for more details.

The second most common cause is that you've set repo.path to point at the
working-directory of your git repo - it should point at the $GITDIR, i.e.
the .git directory.

A less likely cause is that the repo is, infact, not a valid repo. Try
to run 'git show' in the offending repo to see if git also thinks your
repo has issues.
