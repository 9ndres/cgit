Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

This is a compilation of frequently asked questions on the cgit mailing
list. If you've got a cgit problem and cannot find an answer here, please
send a request to cgit@lists.zx2c4.com (and consider sending a patch to the
cgit wiki branch to update this faq if you get a nice answer to your
question). The project also maintains the #cgit channel on Libera.Chat.

### Why doesn't cgit find/show my repo?

This is most likely due to permission problems: cgit runs under your
webserver user account and will need read access to your repo (and all
of the parent directories)


### Why does cgit complain that my repo is "Not a git repository"?

The most common cause of this is permission problems - see the previous
faq entry for more details.

The second most common cause is that you've set repo.path to point at the
working-directory of your git repo - it should point at the $GITDIR, i.e.
the .git directory.

A less likely cause is that the repo is, infact, not a valid repo. Try
to run 'git show' in the offending repo to see if git also thinks your
repo has issues.


### Why is the idle time for my repository wrong?

By default CGit uses the modification time of the default branch's ref
file as a quick method of determining when the repository was last
changed.  If you primarily work on other branches then this work will
not be reflected in the idle time.

You can use a post-receive hook to run a script that tells CGit the
correct modification time by writing to ``info/web/last-modified``.  An
example is provided in the CGit repository at
``contrib/hooks/post-receive.agefile``.
