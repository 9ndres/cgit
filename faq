Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

* I'm using the "scan-path" option, but cgit doesn't find my repo

   * This is most likely due to permission problems: cgit usually runs under
     your webserver user account and will need read access to your repo (and
     all of the parent directories)

* My repo shows up in the list of repositories, but when clicking the
  repo name, cgit complains that it's "Not a git repository"

   * The most common cause of this is permission problems - see the previous
     faq entry for more details.

   * The second most common cause is that you've set repo.path to point
     at the working-directory of your git repo - it should point at the
     $GITDIR, i.e. the .git directory.

   * A less likely cause is that the repo is, infact, not a valid repo. Try
     to run a 'git show' in the offending repo to see if git also reports
     about problems.
